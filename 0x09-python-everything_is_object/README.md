# Project 0x09 Python - Everything is object

Project about Python, containing severall txt files with answer to each task of the project, and some scripts with Python.

Concepts:

    Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
    What is an object
    What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
    What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
    What is a reference
    What is an assignment
    What is an alias
    How to know if two variables are identical
    How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
    How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
    What is mutable and immutable
    What are the built-in mutable types
    What are the built-in immutable types
    How does Python pass variables to functions
