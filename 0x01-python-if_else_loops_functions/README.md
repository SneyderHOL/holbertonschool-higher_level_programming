Decribing each script:

0-positive_or_negative.py is a script that will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed, and print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

1-last_digit.py is a script that will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed, and print whether the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

2-print_alphabet.py is a script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase.

3-print_alphabt.py is a script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, except the letters q and e.

4-print_hexa.py is a script that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

5-print_comb2.py is a script that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

6-print_comb3.py is a script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

7-islower.py is a script that checks for lowercase character.

8-uppercase.py is a script that prints a string in uppercase.

9-print_last_digit.py is a script that prints the last digit of a number.

10-add.py is a script that adds two integers and returns the result.

11-pow.py is a script that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

12-fizzbuzz.py is a script that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

13-insert_number.c, lists.h is a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

100-print_tebahpla.py is a script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.

101-remove_char_at.py is a script that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n.

102-magic_calculation.py is a Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c).
