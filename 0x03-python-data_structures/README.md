# Project 0x03 Python - Data Structures: List, Tuples

Project using Python, containing severall scripts with Python.

Concepts:

    Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
    What are lists and how to use them
    What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
    What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
    How to use lists as stacks and queues
    What are list comprehensions and how to use them
    What are tuples and how to use them
    When to use tuples versus lists
    What is a sequence
    What is tuple packing
    What is sequence unpacking
    What is the del statement and how to use it


Decribing each script:

0-print_list_integer.py is a function that prints all integers of a list.

1-element_at.py is a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

2-replace_in_list.py is a function that replaces an element of a list at specific position (like in C).

3-print_reversed_list_integer.py is a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

4-new_in_list.py is a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

5-no_c.py is a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

6-print_matrix_integer.py is a function that prints a matrix of integers.

7-add_tuple.py is a function that adds 2 tuples.

8-multiple_returns.py is a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9-max_integer.py is a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

10-divisible_by_2.py is a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

11-delete_at.py is a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

12-switch.py is a function that switches value a and b.

13-is_palindrome.c is a function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome and lists.h is the header with function prototypes.

100-print_python_list_info.c is a function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
