Project using Python, containing severall scripts with Python.

Concepts:

    Why Python programming is awesome
    Whatâ€™s an interactive test
    Why tests are important
    How to write Docstrings to create tests
    How to write documentation for each module and function
    What are the basic option flags to create tests
    How to find edge cases


Decribing each script:

0-add_integer.py is a function that adds 2 integers, tests/0-add_integer.txt is a test file for script 0.

2-matrix_divided.py is a function that divides all elements of a matrix, tests/2-matrix_divided.txt is a test file for script 2.

3-say_my_name.py is a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>, tests/3-say_my_name.txt is a test file for script 3.
